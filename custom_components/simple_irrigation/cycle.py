"""Cycle → schedule-slot generation (mirrored in frontend/src/cycle.ts).

A *cycle* is a user-facing watering cadence ("Every 2 days", "Twice daily", …).
It is pure presentation + generation metadata: the runtime only ever sees the
generated ``weekdays`` / ``time_local`` / ``week_parity`` on each member slot.

Cycle length is 7 or 14 days because ``week_parity`` can only express a 2-week
cycle. All rules here MUST match ``cycle.ts`` exactly so the wizard preview and
the created slots agree 100 %.
