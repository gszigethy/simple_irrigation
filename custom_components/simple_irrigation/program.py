"""Turn a slot's phases into the steps a run walks through.

A run is a queue of steps. Most steps are a *phase*: the zone ids that water in
parallel. With Cycle & Soak a slot also puts *soaks* into the queue — rests
between phases and between repetitions — so the runtime needs no second code
path for repeated slots: it pops steps and either waters or waits.
